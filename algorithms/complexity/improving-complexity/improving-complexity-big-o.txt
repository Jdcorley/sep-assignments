Improving Complexity One: O(n^2) + O(n^2) therefore Big O(n^2).

Improving Complexity Two: O(n^2) + O(n log n) in worst case still Big O(n^2) because of
the combining arrays step. 

Improving Complexity three: O(1) + O(n^2) I swapped out the combining double each loop 
for arrays.flatten but since sorting essentially stayed the same as the first one Big O
still turns out to be O(n^2).
